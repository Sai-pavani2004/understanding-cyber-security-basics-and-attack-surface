Cybersecurity Basics & Attack Surfaces
📌 Introduction

Cybersecurity is the practice of protecting systems, networks, and data from digital attacks. These attacks often aim to access, change, or destroy sensitive information, disrupt services, or extort money from users or organizations.

An attack surface refers to all the possible points where an attacker can try to enter or extract data from a system.

This repository provides a basic understanding of cybersecurity concepts and common attack surfaces to help beginners learn how attacks happen and how they can be prevented.

🎯 Objectives

Understand basic cybersecurity concepts

Learn what an attack surface is

Identify common attack surfaces

Understand real-world cyber threats

Learn basic security best practices

🔐 Cybersecurity Basics
1. Confidentiality

Ensures that information is accessible only to authorized users.

2. Integrity

Ensures data is not altered or tampered with without authorization.

3. Availability

Ensures systems and data are available when needed.

These three principles are known as the CIA Triad.

⚔️ What is an Attack Surface?

An attack surface is the total number of vulnerabilities, entry points, or attack vectors that attackers can exploit to gain unauthorized access to a system.

The larger the attack surface, the higher the risk.

🧩 Types of Attack Surfaces
1. Network Attack Surface

Open ports

Firewalls

Routers and switches

VPN connections

Examples:

Port scanning

DDoS attacks

Man-in-the-Middle attacks

2. Application Attack Surface

Web applications

APIs

Input forms

Authentication mechanisms

Examples:

SQL Injection

Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

Broken authentication

3. System / Host Attack Surface

Operating systems

Installed software

Unpatched vulnerabilities

Examples:

Privilege escalation

Malware infection

Exploiting outdated software

4. Human Attack Surface

Users and employees

Weak passwords

Lack of security awareness

Examples:

Phishing attacks

Social engineering

Insider threats

5. Physical Attack Surface

USB devices

Servers

Laptops and mobile devices

Examples:

Unauthorized device access

Hardware theft

Malicious USB attacks
